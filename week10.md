For this week's portfolio, I will focus on code review, managing conflict errors and merging feature branches into the development branch.

## Code Review ##

Last week, I undertook a code review and commented that it lacked comments and and had commented out code.  This week I reviewed the same code and noticed tht these issues have been corrected.  The feature branch was ready for merging into the development branch.

Firstly, I added comments in the reivew and approved (fig 1)
