### GitHub and repo setup

Given that I already had a GitHub account and wished to get more experience in using the platform, I volunteered to setup the group account

The following steps were undertaken to acheive this. **Please note that these steps create a new remote repo, not clone it**

Firstly, open up Visual Studio and create a new project

Search for MAUI template and choose .NET MAUI App then click on Next at the botton right hand side of the screen

Choose the same of the project and click on next

In Additional information, select .NET 6.0. This was chosen over .NET 7.0 as the newer version is only a short term support release.

Once the project has been built, click on Add to Source Control which is found at the button right hand side of the screen.  

The Create a Git repository dialog box will appear. As Visual Studio was already linked to my GitHub account, i did not need to provide these details.
Visual Studio default .gitignore template was added to prevent unncessary files unrelated to the project from being pushed to the remote depository.
It was dicided to keep the repository private to mitigate against plagiarism

Once the details have been entered, click on Create and Push

The remote repository will now appear in GitHub.

As the repository is private, collaborators were added using the settings tab.  Email invites were sent out to their academic addresses

### Configuring a personal copy of visual studio appropriately

Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 already installed on machine.  .NET MAUI confirmed by looking at Visual Studio installer tool

Microsoft SQL Server was installed as part of the requirements for the project. SQL Server 2022 Develop was installed from https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads

### Cloning the shared repository

As I am the owner of the group repo, cloning the shared repository was not applicable as I created the local repository before creating and pushing to the remote repo
