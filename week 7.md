## Code Review

The GitHub account was setup so that any merges from a feature branch to the development bracnh required a pull request.  The purpose of this was to ensure that the code can be viewed directly in GitHub prior to merge. If there was any issues with the code, the pull request could be revolked and feedback provided. That way the code would be kept clean prior to merging.

Here, I am reviewing the datatabase constrants class directly in GitHub. 

Firstly, I viewed the Pull Requests from the main menu in GitHub to view awaing PRs (fig 1).  The top PR was selected

Next, the link circled in red was clicked (fig 2) to view changes made in the pull request (fig 3)

The code marked in green in figure 3 is the requested changes made. This was the code that was reviewed
